# ShinyCount+ v1.2.1
## NOW FULLY RELEASED
Attempt number three at a shiny hunting counter for the Pokemon games. Better UI, better optimization, better features.
(I'm gonna admit I started this before I learned about WPF, so yes this is all in WinForms)

## Features
- Select and display current target Pokemon
- Select current hunting method
- Display hunting method and current odds on main screen
- Set custom interval for counter (great for multi-system hunting)
- Enter custom encounter value for picking up previous hunts
- Set window opacity (great for multitasking)
- Pin window to foreground
- Choose from four accent color options (more to come)

## Todo
- Dark mode
- Custom keybinds
- Discord Rish Presence?
- Mark target as caught, view caught targets in nice grid view (maybe)

## Installation
- Must be running Windows 7 or later with .NET 4.8
- Go to the releases page, where the newest version will be at the top
- Download setup.exe, ignore other files
- Run setup.exe to install the program, and it will launch automatically
- Windows Defender/Chrome may give a false positive, likely due to the program lacking a certificate (don't have the money for that) and trying to install to your system.
